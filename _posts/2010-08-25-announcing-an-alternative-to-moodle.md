With this post I'm announcing my [Google Summer of Code 2010 project][1] as finished.

The [BuddyPress Courseware today got it's home][2], along with the [first stable version: 0.1][3]
I'm very happy to report that this was an awesome experience, and the final results kick ass. Not to forget my mentors that helped a lot during the last 3 months: [Jeremy Boggs][4] and [Boone B. Gorges][5], and [a whole community of colleagues][6]! Thanks and come join the team, since the [project development continues][7]!
