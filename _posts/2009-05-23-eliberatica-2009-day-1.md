I was writing on GSL blog about [some of the things that happened at eLiberatica today][1]. The most important thing is actually the fact that we [finally gained all together][2], Diacritice, Firebird, Fedora-ro, GSL, ROSEdu, Mozilla-ro and Ubuntu-ro. I must say it was a fantastic day for me. Of course there were some details that might be done better, but this is only my opinion and I might be wrong. The most valuable presentation I think was the one by [Georg Greve][3], this guy is at fsf-eu, and later, after his presentation, we discussed some points that can help [GSL][4] in one or another way. I must bring credits to the guys from [ROSEdu][5], which IMHO are some really open-minded hackers which rocked all day by helping us out and creating this day really special for all Romanian FLOSS fans/visitors. I'm hope I'll get some time tomorrow to talk the guys from [Ceata][6], [S. Buraga][7] and Teo Teodorescu. The event itself is worth to be visited, tomorrow speakers presentations are to be even greater.
