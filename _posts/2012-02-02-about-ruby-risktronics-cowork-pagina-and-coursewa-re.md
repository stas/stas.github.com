_(^^Not necessarily in that order...)_

October 2011, 6th, I refuse one job proposal and reply back with sorry messages to [another][7] 2 emails. Later, one of the guys whom I refuse, picks up the Cluj CoWork concept, and builds [probably the most awesome working space for freelancers in Cluj-Napoca][8] (website to be launched soon).

<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>First release in production since 6th of Oct. Nailed! Happy new year! <a href="http://t.co/1CXEZoER" title="http://risktronics.net">risktronics.net</a></p>&mdash; Risktronics (@Risktronics) <a href="https://twitter.com/Risktronics/status/153167212679667713" data-datetime="2011-12-31T17:34:43+00:00">December 31, 2011</a></blockquote>

Meanwhile, 3 months later, the reason I refused those great people with interesting teams and projects gets online: [Risktronics.net][9] (about what I still can not disclose much, and yes, the deploy ended like 3 hours before 2012 New Year). During these 3 months, with some cash from last GSoC, and a fuzzy idea, I switch to Ruby to build the startup that hopefully can "fix banks" or at least help people get credits easier, all this together with two old friends of mine. Lately, here we are now, [with a working prototype][10] that after some tweaks will become open to public beta testing. As you expect, with no money, and no certain future :)

Looking back, recalling my mum and some friends question, "is it worth?", the answer is definitely positive, but not in a "pinkish way". Actually, deciding to do the opposite, would probably forever leave me with a sense of regret, and would never motivate myself enough doing something else than what I know already. What would be fair to mention is that, jumping from one set of tools to another, makes you discover a lot of great stuff and needs which basically invites you to explore.

<div class="embed tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Updated Pagina gem, ditched Sinatra for plain Rack, code simplified a lot! <a href="https://t.co/lZLo5RIs" title="https://github.com/stas/pagina">github.com/stas/pagina</a></p>&mdash; Stas Su»ôcov (@Suscov) <a href="https://twitter.com/Suscov/status/155044325779177472" data-datetime="2012-01-05T21:53:42+00:00">January 5, 2012</a></blockquote>

To confirm the above, the same time, I wrote [Pagina][11], which is a Rack web app, that came up from a simple idea of having your website content in your Dropbox (Stumbled upon [Drop Pages][12] later in winter 2011). Later Pagina is used to build the [Coursewa.re][13] and helps [some friends of mine][14] (they work as attorneys) finally integrate their website management tasks into daily workflow (they use Dropbox a lot for collaboration).

[Coursewa.re][13] meanwhile brings no money/big-real-world-projects, but a lot of interest which both upsets me and pleases. Hopefully I can roll out in spring the SaaS platform I've been planing for one year or so... To wrap up, there was a lot of fun for last couple of months, and I'm lucky I could meet so many great people and use [so][15] [much][16] [great][17] [code][18].
