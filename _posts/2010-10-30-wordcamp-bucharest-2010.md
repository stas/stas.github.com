Well, [it's over][1], and it was ok (people say, much better than previous year). Thanks a lot to the [guys behind the event][2] for invitation, the people that came and [Cristi][3] for not letting me alone all along the event. Met:

  * [Bogo][4] and some old friends from free software communities
  * [Dream Production team][5] (again :P)
  * some newcomers (which I hope will poke me around later for getting into [ro.wordpress.org][6])

My slides are [on github][7]. Guys from Cluj, I've stolen stickers with
WordPress, Gravatar and PollDaddy, so If you meet me, ask for them (I can be
found usually at [Insomnia][8], till late evenings coding/hacking stuff)!
P.S.: I still hate Bucharest, and I saw [The Social Network][9] (not that much
impressed)...
