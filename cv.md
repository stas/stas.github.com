# Stas Sușcov

Generally, I like being an early technical employee at various startups in
various industries where I help teams with new product development/transition,
remote culture, open-source presence and eclectic contributions to the `#music`
channel on their Slack.
\
\
I also ran a conference, and helped build a co-working space.
\
\
Now, I live in Portugal, where I like to surf, cook and travel at times. I
like the minimalism and just generally try to keep things simple.
\
\
[`Founden`](https://founden.com) is sort of my personal brand, and you can email
me at [stas@founden.com](mailto:stas@founden.com).
