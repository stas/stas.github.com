title: About money, passion, and why not

I've been thinking about a couple of things these days, like:

  * why my studies at faculty are not much important to me
  * why I don't like most of my colleagues
  * why I'm following and making my rules
  * and so on...

Let me try a simple explanation. You should know that no matter who are you
willing to become, or who are you, there are and will always be people that
will be able (of course if they need it) to buy you (not directly, I mean
buying what you're doing or your time), except in one case: if you (not
directly, but your work or your time) are driven by passion in everything you
do. And here's where I'm different (not because I'm not following the classes,
not because I'm not attending the same places other do, not because I'm a
linux guy), because what I'm doing is driven by passion. And it's a pity my
list I build over there above, involves so little passion from the guys who
put it all together.
