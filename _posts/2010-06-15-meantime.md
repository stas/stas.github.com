I didn't want to write about this until I had something to show, now I got some updates and I think I will be the last person involved in this project who didn't write anything about it yet.
Yes, I was accepted as a [Google Summer of Code student][1] this year.
And the umbrella project I will be am working for is [WordPress][2] (which is the best I could only dream about) and their social network project called [BuddyPress][3]. So what coding exactly I'm doing this summer? Remember Moodle, or Blackboard (yep, that was new to me too) or if you know what is a LMS, well, I am building [a LMS above the BuddyPress][4] social network. This means everyone can get a facebook/ning and a moodle in a box once the project is done. The crew. Besides me there are two more mentors:

  * [Jeremy Boggs][5] -- The initiator of [ScholarPress][6] project from where I will borrow code and implementation ideas.
  * [Boone Gorges][7] -- The all things BuddyPress guy.

and a bunch of people I have to mention for their support and ideas:
[Jane][8], [Kyle][9], [WP-Edu subscribers][10]. The project timeline and
updates can be followed on [my other blog][11]. Also there you will find, [the
instructions][12] for how to install the new component.
