Suppose you want to move from the university you've been admitted to with scholarship, and you are ready to cancel it and start paying for your studies at the new university. You solved all the paper related problems, but the Ministry doesn't want to accept your move to the new university. How can you explain such a situation? What would you do?

They are offering you to return back to the old university where you canceled all the stuff related to your accommodation, payed all of the taxes required for move, moved all your stuff and kick the new university staff which helped you and waited more than a month for Ministry decision. Or, cancel all the old studies you did, and wait for the next fall to apply for a new schollarship (whenever it will be a full one from Ministry like I have now, or the one I'm ready to afford where all the taxes are payed by me, any of these scholarships you will surely obtain once applied).

The reason they didn't agree, is because my _medical recommendations are not reasonable enough for them_ so they can not allow my move.

Next week I obtained an audience at the Department for Foreign Affairs at the Ministry of Education, but the lady from the phone said it ain't gonna solve anything.
