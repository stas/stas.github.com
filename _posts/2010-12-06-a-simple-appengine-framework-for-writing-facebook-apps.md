title: A simple AppEngine framework for writing Facebook apps

During last year, I wrote a couple of Facebook apps. I used both, the beloved (by Facebook) [PHP library for that][1] and the [Python library][2], and (not) surprisingly I found that writing Facebook apps on Python (and mostly because you have the handy [AppEngine][3] for deploying those) is way easier and needs no special treatment from your customers (you handle them the code and access to the application panel). So along with my projects I used mostly the same approach, ending up with the code I published today on github. [This][4] is a simple MVC like framework, which I recommend checking out to anyone who wants to try [writing the Facebook apps ][5]on Google's AppEngine.
