I'm a big fan of [OpenVZ virtualization][1].
This server runs on OpenVZ, ubuntu-ro and SbLUG also use it.

Along time I received a couple of questions regarding different setups, most of them resulted into an experience I started to share basically using a setup example below.
The classic situation usually is a single server with two HDDs and such requirements like ability to snapshot, backup along with RAID and LVM stuff included.

About half a year ago, what I wrote above helped me and other friends understand a complex setup with OpenVZ, so I said to publish it now on my blog. There might be questions, if so just ask.
