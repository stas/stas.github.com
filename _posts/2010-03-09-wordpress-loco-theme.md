So the [awesome drupal loco][1] is dead... (ex lp:~drupal-loco). I was working on [ubuntu-md loco website][2], so I said to create a WordPress ubuntu loco theme from scratch. The results were nice so I said to publish everything to Launchpad. Hope all that stuff will become useful one day to other loco teams.

If you are interested, checkout the project:
[WordPress Loco Theme][3] or get the code: `bzr branch lp:~sushkov/wordpress-loco/trunk`.
Branching is welcomed!

The plans for future... Knowing that [ubuntu.com will get re-branded][4],
I'm interested to continue the wordpress-loco development to reflect new brand changes.
Maybe even rewrite the plugins needed for loco teams to connect to Launchpad. Time will show, so far I'm trying to bring up some loco activity in Moldova, and I hope [we'll even get a release party for upcoming Lucid 10.4][5]...

Full technical, specific descriptions and kudos list is available in the [README][6] file.
