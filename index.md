## Stas Sușcov

I live in Cluj-Napoca, Transylvania. After years of involvement
in open source I start building startups for fun and profit.

I co-created
[Circularia](http://circularia.com) in 2011 and then
started [Courseware](http://coursewa.re) in 2012.
In 2013 I joined [Geekcelerator](http://geekcelerator.com)
as the tech lead.

I'm hooked on [Github](https://github.com/stas).
Sometimes I share tech tips on [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/stas).
If I read or write non-technical bits,
it's usually on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Suscov).

To get in touch with me, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suscov)
or email me at stas@nerd.ro

If you are in Cluj-Napoca, stop by [ClujCowork](http://clujcowork.ro),
it's a place where some really nice people work together,
and where I share a desk.
