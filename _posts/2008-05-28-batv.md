> Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) is the name of a method, defined in an
Internet Draft, for determining whether the bounce address specified in an
E-mail message is valid. It is designed to reject backscatter, that is, bounce
messages to forged return addresses.

[(From Wikipedia)][1]

I was reading a thread on ["dkim-milter-discuss" list on SourceForge][2],
where MSK (Murray S. Kucherawy) was announcing "[batv-milter][3]". A filter
which uses [BATV][4] that [attempts to mitigate backscatter][5]. Although the
method only [exists as a draft][6], I was wondering if somebody tried it
already, and if any great web mail company respects this type of email
signing?
